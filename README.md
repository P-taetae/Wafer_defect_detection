## Abstract
In semiconductor engineering, high yield of wafers relies on accurate detection and classification of wafer defects.
The dataset for detecting wafer defects presents three primary challenges: i) different background types, ii) variable image or defect scales, and iii) imbalanced data with a long-tailed distribution of defect types. These challenges create significant limitations for traditional classification techniques. To address these issues, we propose a stratified framework called WaferDC, designed specifically for detecting and classifying wafer defects from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.
Our framework achieves high defect detection performance on SEM wafer images by utilizing a multi-cluster memory bank, which effectively handles the challenges of i) variable background types and ii) differing image or defect scales.
Building on this robust detection, we propose SegMix, a novel defect augmentation technique based on anomaly heatmaps, which enhances the reliability of defect detection and classification in a iii) long-tailed imbalanced environment. 
Finally, we pass defect-classified images through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based classifier utilizing a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, further improving overall defect detection and classification performance.
We rigorously tested WaferDC on a proprietary SEM wafer dataset and the public DTD-Synthetic and Magnetic Tile Defect (MTD) datasets. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving defect detection and classification in wafer manufacturing.

## Contribution
- We introduce WaferDC, designed to address the three challenges mentioned above and enhance wafer defect detection and classification accuracies in SEM images.

- To improve the performance of wafer defect detection across various SEM image backgrounds and scales, we propose a novel multi-cluster memory bank strategy, where each cluster represents a different background type and scale in wafer defects. This also contributes to the enhanced quality of augmented defect images later on.

- We introduce a new defect augmentation method called SegMix, which utilizes the anomaly segmentation map from the multi-cluster memory bank to extract precise defect areas and adopts smooth blending to synthesize realistic SEM images with defects.
As will be shown later, the added synthetic data is not just confined to train the defect classifier but also used to adjust defect detection thresholds for the multi-cluster memory bank, leading to an overall enhanced framework performance.

- We have extensively evaluated WaferDC on a proprietary SEM wafer dataset and public DTD-Synthetic and the Magnetic Tile Defect (MTD) datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the capability of our approach in enhancing defect detection and classification performance.
